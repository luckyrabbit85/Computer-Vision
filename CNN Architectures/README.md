# CNN-Architectures

Here I try to explain various computer vision architectures and implement the same using Tensorflow Keras framework.

### 1. AlexNet
Introduced by Krizhevsky et al. in ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
 
AlexNet is a classic convolutional neural network architecture. It consists of convolutions, max pooling and dense layers as the basic building blocks. Grouped convolutions are used in order to fit the model across two GPUs.
